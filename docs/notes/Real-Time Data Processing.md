Apache Flink is a powerful tool in real-time data architecture due to its ability to handle high-throughput, low-latency data processing. It is designed for event-driven applications and provides accurate, consistent results, even in the face of out-of-order events. Flink's stream processing capabilities make it suitable for real-time analytics, complex event processing, and data-driven applications.

In terms of OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) comparisons, Apache Flink allows for real-time data processing, enabling immediate insights and decision-making. This is in contrast to traditional OLAP systems, which often involve batch processing and can result in delays. Flink's stream processing model provides continuous data ingestion and processing, which is ideal for dynamic and rapidly changing data environments.

As for alternatives to Apache Flink, some notable options include:

1. **Apache Kafka Streams**: A lightweight library for building streaming applications and microservices, integrated with Apache Kafka.
2. **Apache Storm**: An older, yet still relevant, distributed real-time computation system that is designed for processing large streams of data.
3. **Apache Spark Streaming**: Part of the Apache Spark ecosystem, it provides scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing.
4. **Google Cloud Dataflow**: A fully managed service for stream and batch processing, designed to work seamlessly with Google Cloud Platform.
5. **Amazon Kinesis**: A platform on AWS to collect, process, and analyze real-time streaming data.

Each alternative comes with its own strengths and trade-offs, so the choice of tool often depends on specific use case requirements, existing infrastructure, and scalability needs.

Yes, with technologies like Apache Flink, you can essentially persist SQL queries as streams. Flink SQL allows you to define continuous queries on streaming data, enabling you to process and analyze streams of data in real time. This approach allows for the transformation and aggregation of data as it flows through the system, providing immediate insights and actions based on the results of these persistent queries.
