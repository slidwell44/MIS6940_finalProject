1. **Data Localization**
    - **Store Data Only in the U.S.:** All ITAR-controlled data must reside on servers physically located within the
    United States.
2. **Access Control**
    - **Restrict Access to U.S. Persons:** Only U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or protected individuals may access
    ITAR data.
3. **ITAR-Compliant Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)**
    - **Use Authorized CSPs:** Select cloud providers that explicitly support ITAR compliance and have U.S.-based data
    centers.
4. **Data Segregation**
    - **Isolate ITAR Data:** Ensure ITAR data is stored in dedicated or segmented environments to prevent co-mingling
    with non-controlled data.
5. **Encryption**
    - **Encrypt Data at Rest and in Transit:** Utilize FIPS 140-2 validated encryption for all ITAR-controlled data.
6. **No Foreign Access**
    - **Prevent Foreign Personnel Access:** Ensure that neither CSP employees nor third-party subcontractors can access
    ITAR data unless they qualify as U.S. persons.
7. **Contractual Agreements**
    - **Establish Business Associate Agreements (BAAs):** Formalize agreements with CSPs that mandate ITAR compliance
    and include audit rights.
8. **Physical and Logical Security**
    - **Implement Robust Security Measures:** Ensure CSPs have strong physical security for data centers and enforce
    logical security controls like role-based access and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
9. **Incident Response and Reporting**
    - **Maintain an Incident Response Plan:** Develop and implement plans to address data breaches or security incidents
    involving ITAR data.
    - **Mandatory Reporting:** Promptly report any security incidents as required by ITAR regulations.
10. **Continuous Monitoring and Auditing**
    - **Monitor Compliance Continuously:** Use tools and processes to continuously oversee cloud environments for
    security threats and compliance adherence.
    - **Maintain Audit Trails:** Keep detailed logs of data access and system activities for auditing purposes.
11. **Employee Training and Awareness**
    - **Provide ITAR Compliance Training:** Ensure all personnel handling ITAR data are trained on ITAR requirements and
    best security practices.
12. **Data Management Practices**
    - **Secure Key Management:** Manage encryption keys securely, keeping them separate from the encrypted data.
    - **Proper Data Handling:** Establish clear procedures for the creation, access, transmission, and disposal of
    ITAR-controlled data.
13. **Prohibited Practices**
    - **Avoid Unauthorized Cloud Services:** Do not use public or non-ITAR-compliant cloud services for storing ITAR
    data.
    - **Prevent Unauthorized Data Transfers:** Ensure ITAR data is not inadvertently shared or transferred to foreign
    jurisdictions.

**Summary:**
To comply with ITAR when storing data in the cloud, ensure data is hosted exclusively in U.S.-based, ITAR-compliant
cloud environments, restrict access to authorized U.S. persons, implement strong encryption and security measures,
isolate ITAR data from other data, establish robust contractual agreements with cloud providers, maintain continuous
monitoring and auditing, and provide comprehensive training for all personnel handling sensitive information.
